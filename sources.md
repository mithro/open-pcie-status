The wrapper intends to support multiple protocols via the PIPE interface (PCIe, SATA, DisplayPort) but currently targets USB 3.0 SuperSpeed when paired with a modified Daisho USB 3 core【498213146566547†L36-L39】. It notes that the design targets Xilinx Kintex7 and Artix7 devices and currently uses the Xilinx Vivado toolchain, with future support planned for F4PGA【498213146566547†L42-L70】.

7. <a id="source7"></a> **Warp Pipe – Introduction and PCI Express documentation (Antmicro)**. Warp Pipe is a library for creating PCIe links in distributed simulation environments. It packetises and depacketises PCIe transactions into DLLPs and TLPs, transmits them over sockets using a custom PCIe‑over‑TCP protocol, creates links between simulators (such as Renode and QEMU), and handles message‑signaled interrupts (MSIs), packet routing, and flow control【116221358830330†L23-L38】. The PCIe section summarises the physical layer (LVDS lanes with 8b/10b or 128b/130b encoding and clock recovery), categories of Data Link Layer packets (ACK, NAK, flow‑control, power management), and describes transaction types for memory, I/O and configuration【648893813154890†L23-L105】.
